Compiled using Visual C++ Express Edition 2010

Main Program: ScreenSaverProgram.cpp

Stand Alone Classes:
	Vertex (vertex.h, vertexpriv.h, verteximpl.cpp)
	Shapes (Basic_Shapes.h, Basic_Shapes.cpp)

You must install the OpenGL and GLUT libraries before you can use this code:

	http://www.opengl.org/

After this, you need to change the #include<GLUT/GLUT> and #include<OpenGL/OpenGL> so that they point to where you have
saved those libraries.
