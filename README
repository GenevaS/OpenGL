Compiled using Visual C++ Express 2010 with OpenGL and GLUT

Main Program: TerrainGenerator.cpp

Stand Alone Classes:
	HeightMapMesh (HeightMapMesh.h, HeightMapMeshpriv.h, HeightMapMeshimpl.cpp)

You must install the OpenGL and GLUT libraries before you can use this code:

	http://www.opengl.org/

After this, you need to change the #include<GLUT/GLUT> and #include<OpenGL/OpenGL> so that they point to where you have
saved those libraries.
